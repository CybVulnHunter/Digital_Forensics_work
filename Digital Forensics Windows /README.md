# Introduction to Windows Forensics Tools

Windows forensics tools are essential utilities used by digital investigators to analyze, recover, and interpret data from Windows-based systems. These tools assist in uncovering evidence related to cybercrimes, system misuse, or unauthorized access. They help extract valuable information from system logs, registry files, memory dumps, deleted files, and internet activity. Common functionalities include timeline analysis, keyword searches, file recovery, and event log examination. Tools like FTK Imager, Autopsy, HxD, and WinHex are widely used in forensic investigations to ensure data integrity while maintaining a proper chain of custody. These tools play a vital role in both reactive investigations and proactive monitoring in digital forensic environments.

# Types of Windows Artifacts
Forensic artifacts on the Windows operatying system can generally be split into four main categories:

 1. Registry 
 2. Filesystem
 3. Event Log
 4. Memory

**Registry** artifacts are found in the Windows registry, which is loaded into memory while a system is in operation and written to disk during shutdown. The registry stores low-level configuration settings for the operating system and contains a wealth of forensic artifacts of interest to an analyst.

**Filesystem** artifacts are artifacts that arise due to the operation of Windows' filesystem - NTFS (New Technology File System).

**Event log** artifacts are found in the Windows event log and consist primarily of audit logs from the operating system and its applications. 

**Memory** artifacts are those artifacts found in the endpoint's memory while it is operational. These artifacts must be collected from a live system, and are generally not applicable to dead disk forensics with certain exceptions such as page files and hibernation files that consist of memory that has been written to the disk. 

A complete forensic analysis of a Windows endpoint will consist of one or all of these artifacts. They may be collected and parsed individually at the analyst's discretion, or consolidated into "super timelines" with forensic software such as [log2timeline](https://github.com/log2timeline).

# How to Use this Guide

This guide was created to classify the numerous Windows forensic artifacts and provide a concise list of what information they respectively provide. While it may be used as a general reference, it shines when it comes time to tie separate artifacts together based on mutual/shared datapoints.

For instance, if it is known that an attacker has logged into an endpoint around a certain time, an analyst may want to determine what activity on the endpoint can be attributed to this session. For this, the analyst might begin by looking at 4624 Login events and pull the `Logon ID` from this artifact. This guide provides a list of every artifact that has the `Logon ID` field present, providing a quick way to correlate logon activity with other activity on the endpoint filed under the section [Logon ID](#account---logon-id).

As another example, say for instance you are aware that an endpoint may have a malicious file on it. Maybe you want to see [when the file was created](#file---creation), or [when it was first executed](#execution---first-executed). What about determining [what Logon ID is associated with the execution with 4688 events?](#account---logon-id)

Building a visual map in your mind of the relationships between all the artifacts present in Windows is necessary to allow for an analyst to efficiently pivot their focus during an investigation, this guide simply lays it all out and provides useful analysis tips collected during years of forensic experience while doing so.

 - [TA0002 - Execution](#ta0002-execution)
 - [TA0003 - Persistence](#ta0003-persistence)
 - [TA0008 - Lateral Movement](#ta0008-lateral-movement)
