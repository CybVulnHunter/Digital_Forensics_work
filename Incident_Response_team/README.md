# 🚨 Incident Response Team (IRT) Guide

## 🔍 What is an Incident Response Team (IRT)?
An **Incident Response Team (IRT)** is a specialized group within an organization responsible for identifying, analyzing, containing, and mitigating security incidents. The primary goal of an IRT is to minimize the impact of cyber threats and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

### 🎯 Key Responsibilities of an IRT:
- **📡 Monitoring & Detection** – Continuously monitor for potential threats.
- **🛠️ Investigation & Analysis** – Identify root causes and assess the impact.
- **🚧 Containment** – Prevent further damage by isolating affected systems.
- **🔄 Eradication** – Remove malicious components and vulnerabilities.
- **🛠️ Recovery** – Restore systems to normal operations.
- **📜 Documentation & Reporting** – Maintain logs, reports, and recommendations.
- **🎓 Lessons Learned** – Improve security posture by learning from past incidents.

## 🏢 Types of Incident Response Teams
There are different types of Incident Response Teams based on their scope and operational model:

### 1️⃣ **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)** 🖥️
- A formalized team within an organization.
- Responsible for responding to and mitigating security incidents.
- Often provides security guidance and awareness training.

### 2️⃣ **Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)** ⚠️
- Similar to CSIRT but more focused on emergency response and recovery.
- Often operates at national or industry levels.
- Provides cybersecurity alerts and best practices.

### 3️⃣ **Security Operations Center (SOC) Team** 🏢
- Monitors and defends an organization's network 24/7.
- Uses **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)** tools to detect anomalies.
- Works closely with IR teams to respond to threats.

### 4️⃣ **Internal Incident Response Team** 🔒
- An in-house team responsible for handling incidents within a company.
- Often collaborates with other departments (IT, HR, Legal, Compliance).
- May use external consultants for forensic investigations.

### 5️⃣ **External/Third-Party Incident Response Team** 🌍
- A hired team that provides incident response services.
- Useful for organizations that lack internal security expertise.
- Provides rapid support during critical incidents.

### 6️⃣ **Hybrid Incident Response Team** 🔄
- A mix of internal and external teams.
- Internal team handles day-to-day incidents, while external experts assist with complex cases.
- Ensures continuous protection and expert-level incident handling.
