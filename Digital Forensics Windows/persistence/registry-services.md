The Services registry key, located in the SYSTEM hive, stores information regarding installed services on the endpoint. It is useful when searching for evidence of persistence mechanisms on an endpoint.

## Artifact Interpretation
Within the `Services` key you will find subkeys, one for each service installed on an endpoint. 

The values within this key may be interpreted as follows:

| Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| DisplayName | The name of the service as it would appear in `services.msc` |
| Description | The description of the service as it would appear in `services.msc` |
| ImagePath | The path to the executable for this service |
| Start | Start mode of the service |
| Type | Type of service |

The Last Write Timestamp for each service key represents the time at which the service was installed or modified.

Additionally, for each service there may be an optional `Parameters` subkey. This key may contain any options that are passed to the executable when the service is started. Certain service installers such as NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) will show the "true" executable for the service under this `Parameters` key.  

### Interpreting the ```Start``` Value
| Value | Interpretation |
| - | - |
| 0 | **Boot** - Service is a device driver |
| 1 | **System** - Service is a device driver |
| 2 | **Automatic** - Service and all of its dependency services is started on boot by the OS |
| 3 | **Manual** - Service is started manually by user interaction |
| 4 | **Disabled** - Service is disabled and cannot be started automatically or manually |
